# Statistical Analysis of Employee Attrition


This is a statistical analysis project that investigates employee attrition in a company. The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data and draw insights from it. The project is mainly focused on answering the following questions:

- What is the attrition rate of employees in the company?

- What are the factors that contribute to employee attrition?

- Can we predict which employees are more likely to leave the company?

- What recommendations can be made to reduce employee attrition?


## Dependencies

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- scipy

## Running the Project

To run the project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine and open the Hands on_Statistics_HR_Analytics.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. You can then run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis and generate the visualizations.

## Results

The results of the analysis are presented in the Hands on_Statistics_HR_Analytics.ipynb notebook file. In this project, a random experiment was carried out using hypothesis testing to determine the relationship between employees with different work conditions.
